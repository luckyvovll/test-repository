            Hello!!! My name is Lumi! Welcome to my website, which is the c00lest website in the underground. I like eating gold soup (not really) and playing with my sister (though she's really bad at games!!!).
I'm usually pretty bored, so my dad told me to try being creative and maybe build a website. First I had to search "how to make a website" over at YOHOO.COM. Unfortunately, the site didn't show anything because I don't think anyone in the underground ever made a website before. I figured I should probably invent the whole internet technology, so I bought a "Coffee Script" programming book and started studying. It took me AGES! The fact my dad kept blowing up my door didn't help. EUGH, why does he always do that? I wish he would get friends or something (DON'T TELL HIM I SAID THAT!!!). Anyway, I finally finished inventing the web, so welcome to my website!</font>

Perhaps pursue a career as an underground pop singer? I decided to go ahead and record myself. I really like how it came out and how it represents a big part of me.
